Here are the data sources for the project, covering both GPS tracking and environmental data:

1. GPS Tracking Data

Use animal GPS tracking datasets from open sources:

	•	Movebank Animal Tracking Data:
	•	Free to access after registration.
	•	Contains GPS data for various species, including timestamps, latitude, longitude, and additional metadata.
	•	Example dataset: African Buffalo Tracking Data.

2. Environmental Data

a. Vegetation Data

	•	MODIS Vegetation Indices (NDVI):
	•	Source: NASA MODIS.
	•	Data includes normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for analyzing plant health and vegetation cover.
	•	Format: GeoTIFF or HDF.

b. Weather Data

	•	NOAA Weather Data:
	•	Source: NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO).
	•	Contains temperature, precipitation, and other weather variables by location and time.
	•	Can be downloaded via the NOAA API.

c. Topographic Data

	•	NASA Earthdata SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission):
	•	Source: NASA Earthdata.
	•	Provides high-resolution elevation data for analyzing terrain.

d. Precipitation Data

	•	Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM):
	•	Source: NASA GPM Data Portal.
	•	Includes rainfall data at various time intervals, available via API.

3. Integration Strategy

	•	Step 1: Download or fetch GPS tracking data from Movebank.
	•	Step 2: Use APIs or bulk download tools to fetch satellite data (NDVI, weather, etc.) from NASA or NOAA.
	•	Step 3: Store raw data in the data/raw/ folder in formats such as CSV, GeoJSON, or GeoTIFF.
